# Work Hours vs National Average

This project compares **my average work hours and wages** with the **national average**.

It calculates:
- Yearly hours worked
- Yearly income
- Differences in hours and income
- Percentage differences

It also generates charts to visualize:
- Yearly totals (hours & income)
- Percentage differences

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3 and matplotlib if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the script:
